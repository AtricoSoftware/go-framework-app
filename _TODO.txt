TODO
~~~~
move verbose writer to api/common (circular imports)
remove names from struct init (safer as missing values causes error)

handle settings types better - slices of X (cut off slice, handle X)
cmdline params (see tf-tool)
cache linked to changing config
regex values to core
string set, remove and add to core?
cache - remove and add to core?
validate settings (see tf-tool)
config file template(?)
calculate missing bits (like id) of config
config - list of register functions?
example in commands (see tf-tool)
usage in cmdline (see tf-tool)
return error from api, do something better
MAYBE
cmdline testcases - all options?
